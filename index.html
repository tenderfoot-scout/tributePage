                Genius Engineer
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>In his 17 years of continuous work for the large Austrian industrial company, which he later headed as General Director, he developed the first aerodynamically-shaped, high-performance limousines (winning - with himself behind the wheel - the famous Prince Heinrich Tour). While there he also built trucks and the Landwehr train for the Emperor's army designed to travel on both roadways and railroad tracks, designed aircraft engines (for which he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Vienna) and after the First World War built the first two-seater sports car, the "Sascha," which took first place in the Targa Florio road race.</p>
